DIDoc -- Documentation of Ken's DITool project.
==============================================================================

(TL;DR --> Edit or create a .mkd file and run 'make'.)

The documentation files are all those files that end with '.mkd'.  They're
written in a special format called Markdown.  It's a text-only format that's
meant to be easy for humans to read (and write), and also easy for computers
to convert into HTML.  It's based on conventions from text-based email such as
using stars for emphasis, the character '>' for quoting, and other such
things.  To put it another way, Markdown is markup that doesn't *look* like
it.

HOW TO WRITE THE DOCUMENTATION:
==============================================================================
Edit any of the .mkd files.  Familiarity with the Markdown format will of
course help, but it's pretty obvious how to use it just from looking at it.
In fact the text you're reading right now is in Markdown.  Surprise -- I've
already tricked you into learning it!  :)


HOW TO BUILD/PUBLISH THE DOCUMENTATION:
==============================================================================
Execute the Makefile.  For example, run this command:

    $ make


When you run the Makefile, this will happen:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The code will be analyzed for recognized code elements, such as javascript
  objects or KAML (Ken's Application Markup Language) tags.

* An HTML page will be created for each element containing whatever
  information the program could discover.

* If there exists a markdown file (.mkd) for the element, its content will
  be incorporated into the element's page.

* In fact, *all* markdown files get turned into an HTML page, whether they
  match a code element or not.

* The HTML will be assembled and deployed to the website.

* PROFIT!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CONFIGURING THE BUILD PROCESS:
==============================================================================
To change how the site is built, edit the Makefile.  For example, to change
the destination directory where the web server looks for the site to be, edit
the value of the DESTINATION variable.

Some things to know:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The files in the documentation directory (.mkd) will never be changed
  automatically.  Beyond what is automatically generated, THE MARKDOWN FILES
  *ARE* THE DOCUMENTATION.

* Do not delete the Makefile.  And unless you know what you're doing, don't
  edit it. It describes to the computer the steps for building and publishing
  the website.  

* Everything else that's not documentation -- javascript, css, the scripts that
  build the site -- all live in the 'bin/' directory.  Do not delete the bin/
  directory.  Do not delete anything *in* the bin/ directory.  The documentation
  directory on the top level is for the documentation.
