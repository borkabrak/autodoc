Building Controls
==============================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making a new control means integrating it with the way Control.js works.

* include Control.call() at the end of your constructor

* set the prototype to Control()

* optionally, attach a function to the prototype called
    '[onBuild](onBuild.html)'.  This is
    called at the end of Control.build, if it exists.
